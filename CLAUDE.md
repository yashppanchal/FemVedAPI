# CLAUDE.md — FemVed Backend API
# READ THIS FULLY AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION BEFORE TOUCHING ANY CODE.

---

## 0. AI CONTEXT RULES — READ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

This repository has a pre-built AI context system at `../ai-context/` (one level above `FemVedAPI/`).

**Use it in this order every session:**

1. **Always read `ai-context/project.md` first** — project purpose, tech stack, architecture, patterns, business rules.
2. **Use `ai-context/code-index.md` to locate files** — never glob or search the repo to find a file that is already indexed here.
3. **Prefer module context files from `ai-context/modules/`** — read the relevant module file (`auth.md`, `payments.md`, etc.) before opening any source files in that area.
4. **Never scan the full repository unless explicitly requested** — the context files are the starting point.
5. **Only open files directly related to the current task** — do not read files speculatively.
6. **When new modules are created, update `ai-context/modules/`** with a new module file.
7. **When new services are added, update `ai-context/services.md`** with the service description.
8. **Log major structural changes in `ai-context/changes.md`** — use the date-based entry format defined there.

**Goal:** Minimise token usage and avoid repeated repository analysis across sessions.

## 1. WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

FemVed is an enterprise-grade women's wellness platform. This repo is the **.NET 10 backend API only**.
A separate React frontend (different repo, different engineer) consumes these APIs.

There are 3 modules — build in this order:
1. **Guided Programs** (Live 1:1 expert-led programs) ← We are building this first
2. Recorded Content (video library, Udemy-style) ← Phase 2 later
3. Events / Retreats ← Phase 3 later

## 4. ARCHITECTURE RULES — NEVER VIOLATE

- Controllers are THIN. They only: receive HTTP input → call MediatR → return response. No logic.
- All business logic in Application layer (Command/Query Handlers).
- Domain entities NEVER reference EF Core, MediatR, or any infrastructure concern.
- All interfaces defined in Application layer. All implementations in Infrastructure.
- FluentValidation validators always in a separate file next to their Command class.
- MediatR Pipeline Behaviours: ValidationBehaviour runs first, then LoggingBehaviour, then PerformanceBehaviour (warn if > 500ms).
- Every public method and every controller action must have XML doc comments.
- Every controller action must have `[ProducesResponseType]` Swagger annotations.

---

## 5. DESIGN PATTERNS IN USE

| Pattern | Where Used |
|---|---|
| Repository + Unit of Work | Infrastructure/Persistence |
| CQRS via MediatR | Application layer |
| Factory | PaymentGatewayFactory (selects CashFree or PayPal by country_iso_code) |
| Strategy | NotificationService (selects Email / WhatsApp / SMS at runtime) |
| Observer / Domain Events | Post-payment triggers (MediatR notifications) |
| Options Pattern | Typed config: JwtOptions, SendGridOptions, PayPalOptions, CashFreeOptions, R2Options |
| Pipeline Decorator | MediatR behaviours for validation, logging, performance |

---

## 6. USER ROLES

| role_id | Name | Can Do |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Admin | Everything — CRUD all entities, reports, audit log, publish programs |
| 2 | Expert | Manage own programs, see enrolled users, send progress updates, update own profile |
| 3 | User | Browse catalog, purchase programs, view own purchases |

Use policy-based auth:
- `[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]`
- `[Authorize(Policy = "ExpertOrAdmin")]`
- `[Authorize]` for any authenticated user

---

## 7. BUSINESS RULES — ALWAYS ENFORCE

1. **Email NOT enforced at purchase** (MVP decision) — `is_email_verified` stored but not checked for purchase.
2. **Mobile OTP** — NOT implemented at MVP. Collect number, no verification.
3. **Coupon discount** is capped so final price is never below 1 unit of currency (e.g. min £1, $1, ₹1).
4. **Program status flow**: `DRAFT → PENDING_REVIEW → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED`. Expert creates as DRAFT, Admin publishes.
5. **Admin mutations**: Every change logged to `admin_audit_log` with before/after JSON snapshot.
6. **Expert price changes**: Also logged to `admin_audit_log`.
7. **Payment webhooks**: Signature verified BEFORE any DB update. Reject unverified webhooks with 401.
8. **Refresh token rotation**: Old token revoked immediately when new one is issued.
9. **Soft deletes**: Never hard-delete users, experts, or programs. Set `is_deleted = true`.
10. **Idempotency**: Orders have `idempotency_key` (client-generated UUID). Duplicate key = return existing order.
11. **GDPR**: Users in GB/EU can request data erasure via `POST /api/v1/users/me/gdpr-deletion-request`. Stored in `gdpr_deletion_requests` table, processed manually by Admin.

---

## 8. COUNTRY CODE — DUAL STORAGE

Users register with both:
- `country_dial_code` — what they type: `+91`, `+44`, `+1`
- `country_iso_code` — derived ISO code: `IN`, `GB`, `US`
- `mobile_number` — digits only, no dial code
- `full_mobile` — concatenated: `+917890001234`

**Dial code to ISO mapping** (implement as a utility in Domain layer):
```
+91  → IN
+44  → GB
+1   → US
+61  → AU
+971 → AE
(add more as needed)
```

Payment gateway selection is based on `country_iso_code`:
- `IN` → CashFree
- Anything else → PayPal

---

## 9. STANDARD API RESPONSE FORMAT

Base URL: `/api/v1`

**Success**: HTTP 200/201 with typed response body.

**All errors (4xx / 5xx)**:
```json
{
  "type": "https://femved.com/errors/[error-type]",
  "title": "Human readable title",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Specific detail message",
  "instance": "/api/v1/path/that/failed",
  "errors": {
    "fieldName": ["Validation message"]
  }
}
```

Use `ProblemDetails` (built into ASP.NET Core). Create a global `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` that catches:
- `NotFoundException` → 404
- `ValidationException` (FluentValidation) → 400 with field errors
- `UnauthorizedException` → 401
- `ForbiddenException` → 403
- `DomainException` → 422
- All others → 500 (log full exception, return generic message)

---

## 11. NOTIFICATION TEMPLATES (SendGrid)

| template_key | Trigger | Recipient |
|---|---|---|
| `purchase_success` | Order status → PAID | User |
| `purchase_failed` | Order status → FAILED | User |
| `program_reminder` | 24h before start_date | User |
| `expert_new_enrollment` | Order status → PAID | Expert |
| `password_reset` | Forgot password | User |
| `email_verify` | Manual verify-email request (dormant — endpoint kept for future use) | User |

| `expert_progress_update` | Expert sends update from dashboard | User |

WhatsApp templates (Twilio, pre-approved by Meta before launch):
- `purchase_confirmation_wa`
- `program_reminder_wa`

---

## 12. COMPLETE DATABASE SCHEMA REFERENCE

> The authoritative schema is in `/database/femved_schema.sql`.
> EF Core migrations must match this exactly.
> When creating migrations, always tell me the migration name and what it adds.

### Tables and their purpose:
- `roles` — seed data: Admin(1), Expert(2), User(3)
- `users` — all platform users, dual country code storage
- `refresh_tokens` — JWT refresh token rotation
- `password_reset_tokens` — time-limited email reset links
- `guided_domains` — top-level domain: "Guided 1:1 Care"
- `guided_categories` — category pages (supports subcategories via parent_id)
- `category_whats_included` — bullet list on category hero page
- `category_key_areas` — key support areas listed on category page
- `experts` — expert profiles linked to user accounts. Key columns: `expert_grid_description` (short bio for grid cards, max 500, was `short_bio`), `expert_detailed_description` (detailed bio for program detail page, nullable TEXT)
- `programs` — individual programs per category per expert
- `program_what_you_get` — what's included bullet list on program page
- `program_who_is_this_for` — target audience on program page
- `program_tags` — filter tags (stress, hormones, pcos, gut-health, etc.)
- `program_detail_sections` — heading + description pairs shown on the program detail page (e.g. "Reset Stress Patterns")
- `program_testimonials` — reviews shown on program pages and homepage
- `program_durations` — duration options per program (4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks)
- `duration_prices` — location-specific pricing per duration (IN/GB/US)
- `coupons` — discount codes (PERCENTAGE or FLAT)
- `orders` — purchase records with idempotency key
- `refunds` — refund records linked to orders
- `user_program_access` — post-purchase access record (what user can access)
- `expert_progress_updates` — expert messages to enrolled users
- `notification_log` — audit of all emails/WhatsApp/SMS sent
- `admin_audit_log` — every admin or expert mutation logged with before/after
- `gdpr_deletion_requests` — right to erasure requests from UK/EU users

---

## 13. GUIDED TREE API — EXACT JSON CONTRACT

`GET /api/v1/guided/tree` — public, cached 10 minutes.
The React frontend binds directly to this shape. **Field names must match exactly (camelCase).**

```json
{
  "domains": [
    {
      "domainId": "uuid",
      "domainName": "Guided 1:1 Care",

                "overview": "string",
                "whatYouGet": ["string item 1"],
                "whoIsThisFor": ["string item 1"],
                "detailSections": [
                  {

                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note on durationPrice**: Return the price for the user's detected location.
Detect location from: (1) authenticated user's `country_iso_code`, or (2) `Accept-Language` header, or (3) default to `GB`.
Format: symbol + amount string, e.g. `"£320"`, `"$400"`, `"₹33,000"`.

| **Phase 8** | Admin — full CRUD, reports, audit log, coupon management, GDPR deletion processing |
| **Phase 9** | Hardening — rate limiting, CORS, health checks, reminder background job |
| **Phase 10** | Final docs — README.md polish, Swagger annotations review, deployment checklist |

---

## 16. HOW I WANT YOU TO WORK (CLAUDE CODE RULES)

1. **One phase at a time.** Never start the next phase until I type "Phase X confirmed, proceed."
2. **Before writing any code** for a phase, list every file you will create or modify. Wait for my "go ahead."
3. **After each phase**, show me a curl test command for every new endpoint created.
4. **Ask before deciding** — if there's an ambiguous choice (naming, pattern, exception type), ask me before coding.
5. **Migration discipline** — before running `dotnet ef migrations add`, tell me:
   - The migration name you plan to use
   - Exactly what the migration will add/change
   - Then wait for confirmation.
6. **Always include**:
   - XML doc comments on all public methods and interfaces
   - `[ProducesResponseType]` on all controller actions
   - A FluentValidation class for every Command that has input
7. **Logging**: Every handler logs at start (Information) and end (Information). Errors are logged as Error with full exception. Never log passwords, tokens, or card data.
8. **At the end of every response**, tell me: what you just built, what files were created/modified, and what the next step is.

---

---

## 18. ENROLLMENT / SESSION LIFECYCLE (added post-Phase 8)

### States of `user_program_access.status`
```
NOT_STARTED → ACTIVE → PAUSED → COMPLETED
                   └──────────────▶ COMPLETED
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NOT_STARTED` | Purchase complete, expert hasn't started the program yet (default after payment) |
| `ACTIVE` | Program in progress |
| `PAUSED` | Temporarily on hold |
| `COMPLETED` | Program ended (success or user/expert terminated) |
| `CANCELLED` | Reserved for refund/admin cancellation |

### Who can trigger each action
| Action | Expert (own programs) | Admin | User (own) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `pause` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `resume` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `end` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Audit trail
Every state change writes a row to `program_session_log` (action, performed_by, performed_by_role, note).

### New DB columns on `user_program_access`
- `paused_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL`
- `ended_by UUID NULL` (FK to users — who triggered end)
- `ended_by_role VARCHAR(20) NULL` — `EXPERT | ADMIN | USER`

### New endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/experts/me/enrollments/{accessId}/{start|pause|resume|end}`
- `POST /api/v1/admin/enrollments/{accessId}/{start|pause|resume|end}`
- `POST /api/v1/users/me/enrollments/{accessId}/{pause|end}`

All accept optional `{ "note": "reason" }` body.

### OrderPaidEventHandler
Creates `UserProgramAccess` with `Status = NOT_STARTED` (not ACTIVE) so expert must explicitly start.

---

## 19. FIRST MESSAGE TO SEND ME WHEN I START A NEW SESSION

If the user says "start" or "continue" or asks what to do next — respond with:

"I've read CLAUDE.md. Here is the current state: [summarise what phases are done based on what code exists in the repo]. The next step is Phase [N]: [description]. Before I write any code, here are the files I plan to create: [list]. Shall I proceed?"
